# Kaggle Student Data Analysis Project

## Description
This project is based on a Kaggle-style dataset created and analyzed using Python.
The data is treated like a small student database.

Using pandas and if-else logic, student performance is analyzed based on marks,
attendance, and department.

## What This Project Does
- Creates student data using Python
- Converts data into a pandas DataFrame
- Filters students by department
- Calculates average marks
- Applies if-else logic to assign Pass/Fail status
- Sorts and filters data based on conditions

## Concepts Used
- Python dictionaries
- Pandas DataFrame
- If-else conditions
- Lambda functions
- Data filtering and sorting

## What I Learned
- How to work with real-world style data
- How to apply conditional logic on datasets
- How to analyze data using pandas
- How to upload Kaggle projects to GitHub
